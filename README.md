# Flappy Plane
A simple, physics-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Canvas API. This project demonstrates basic principles of game development, including:

- HTML Canvas: The drawing surface for all game graphics.

- JavaScript Animation Loop: A continuous requestAnimationFrame loop that drives the game's logic and updates.

- Physics Simulation: Implementation of gravity and bouncing to create realistic movement.

- Event Handling: Responding to keyboard input to control the plane's vertical movement.

- Vector Graphics: Utilizing a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image and pre-rendering it to the canvas at a higher resolution to avoid pixelation.
